# Beyond Imagination 홍보 홈페이지 

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 프로젝트 bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 시작하기

첫번째, 개발 서버 실행:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

브라우저를 열어서 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)에 접속하여 결과 확인하기 

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
